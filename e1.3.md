Exercise 1.3.  Define a procedure that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the sum of the squares of the two larger numbers.

```
(define (sum-of-greatest-squared a b c)
  (cond ((and (<= a b) (<= a c)) (+ (* b b)(* c c)))
        ((and (<= b a) (<= b c)) (+ (* a a)(* c c)))
        ((and (<= c a) (<= c c)) (+ (* a a)(* b b)))
  )
)

(sum-of-greatest-squared 2 3 4) ;9 + 16 = 25
(sum-of-greatest-squared 2 2 2) ;4 + 4  = 8
(sum-of-greatest-squared 2 5 2) ;4 + 25 = 29
