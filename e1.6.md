Exercise 1.6.  Alyssa P. Hacker doesn't see why if needs to be provided as a special form. ``Why can't I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of cond?'' she asks. Alyssa's friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she defines a new version of if:

`(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))`

Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:
```
(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
5

(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)
0
```
Delighted, Alyssa uses new-if to rewrite the square-root program:
```
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                     x)))
```
What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots? Explain.

`if` is a special-case condition where evaluation is lazy (interpreter only looks at the consequent if the predicate is false)
when switched to cond, the interpreter evaluates both `(good-enough? guess x)` (which is fine) and
`(sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)`, which produces an infinite recursion.  If this was normal-order, it would be fine,
and it worked well for the simple demonstrations because the values were evaluable (there wasn't a recursive call)
