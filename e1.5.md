Exercise 1.5.  Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is faced with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines the following two procedures:

`(define (p) (p))`
```
(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
      0
      y))
```
Then he evaluates the expression

`(test 0 (p))`

What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation? Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation rule for the special form if is the same whether the interpreter is using normal or applicative order: The predicate expression is evaluated first, and the result determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative expression.)

Normal
```
(if (= x 0) 0 y)
(if (= 0 0) 0 (p))
0
```

Applicative
```
(if (= x 0) 0 y)
(if (= 0 0) 0 (p))
(if (= 0 0) 0 (p))
(if (= 0 0) 0 (p))
where (p) is being substituted with itself forever
```

if it uses normal order, we'll get zero, b/c the evaluation of (p) wouldn't take place until it was needed
and in this case it's not, since x is zero and test would return zero.

if it uses applicative order it will blow up/recurse while trying to figure out what p is - since it's
definition is recursive theis will never stop and the interpreter will hang.
