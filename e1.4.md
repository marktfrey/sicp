Exercise 1.4.  Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

`(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
         ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))`

- - -

For two numbers `a` and `b`
if b is greater than zero return the sum of a and b
if b is less than or equal to zero return the difference of a and b (a - b),
but since b is negative this is equivalent to a - (-b), or a + the absolute value of b

```
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
    ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

(a-plus-abs-b 0 0)   ; 0
(a-plus-abs-b 2 5)   ; 7
(a-plus-abs-b -9 18) ; 9
(a-plus-abs-b 18 -9) ; 27
